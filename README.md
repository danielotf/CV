## About Me
A committed and highly professional individual with extensive experience gained within healthcare services and the education sector. My proven managerial and organisational skills have been gained in administrative and safeguarding roles, such as being a goodSAM volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic and organising a special needs weekend club for autistic kids while at University.

My adaptable and enthusiastic approach to achieving team objectives mixed with my effective communication skills have shown that I am an effective team player who has a flexible approach to working and is always eager for the next challenge.

This combined with my resilience at all levels of work ensures delivery of the highest quality in any environment I am in. After graduating from University with a degree in Sports and exercise medical sciences, my love of problem-solving, and curiosity to find a futureproof career sparked my interest in programming, and that interest has only grown ever since. 

As a Makers Academy Graduate I aim to use my rapidly developing tech skills in industries that are continuously progressing, so I am keen to work in companies that are innovative with their methods and are committed to providing tangible benefits and solutions in their sector, while giving the very best service to their clients.

## Skills
**Effective communicator and excellent team player**<br> 
During The Birmingham Project 2019 held at the University of Birmingham, I was part of a 6-man team that developed a weekly e-newsletter as part of the build-up to the 2022 commonwealth games being held in Birmingham. As someone who was responsible for a major section of the newsletter which was based on interviewing upcoming athletes leading up to the games, I ensured there was clear communication between myself and the rest of the team, this and the whole team is willing to put the team first before individual wants when it came to decision making was pivotal to finishing the newsletter on time. Our aim was to raise awareness in the Birmingham community for individuals of all ages to engage in exercise, increased physical activity and healthier lifestyles, which h we then achieved with the creation of the newsletter. 

**Leadership**<br>
In the summer of 2019, I co-started a weekend community youth club that gives youths and children the opportunity to relax and engage in mental health conversations that are normally stigmatised in todayâ€™s society. This required me to lead the youths in how to have certain conversations which have been deemed uncomfortable and also in activities that helped build their soft skills which would benefit them outside the youth club as well. 

**Organisation & Adaptability**<br>
Having been involved in so many teams from teaching staff and healthcare teams to annual festival hospitality staff, I have had to develop my organisational skills and also the ability to adapt to different situations, especially unprecedented ones. I have shown both these skills in multiple scenarios such as while being an emergency goodSAM volunteer, where I was part of a team that consistently raised, packaged and dispatched adequate food resources for COVID-19 patients. These skills were also used when running a weekend autism scheme for special needs kids while at University, as I organised and arranged play areas for them and also developed innovative ways to help engage autistic children in communicating their
needs, enabling them to also work effectively among themselves.

**Resilience**<br>
Being a very sporty individual, I have had to dig deep especially when it comes to sports competitions and I have been able to translate that to other areas of my life, especially when it comes to academic work and even coding. On numerous occasions, I have been faced with challenges that seemed like there is no way to get around them both programming-related and non-programming scenarios, and I can confidently say my perseverance and diligence have gotten me through them, and have enabled me to consistently finish things that I start, instead of putting them away at any prolonged difficulty. 

**Time Management**<br>
As a degree holder, during the length of my degree, I can confidently say that time management is one of my biggest strengths, as I not only juggled a lot of extra-curricular activities while acquiring a degree that comes with multiple project deadlines per term, but I also managed to run my own business while at University. As time management is a skill that can also be improved, I believe that it is definitely a skill I execute at a very high standard, and can only get better over time.
