## About Me
A committed and highly professional individual with extensive experience gained within healthcare services and the education sector. My proven managerial and organisational skills have been gained in administrative and safe guarding roles, such as being a goodSAM volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic and organising a special needs weekend club for autistic kids while at University.

My adaptable and enthusiastic approach to achieving team objectives mixed with my effective communication skills have shown that I am an effective team player who has a flexible approach to working and is always eager for the next challenge.

This combined with my resilience at all levels of work ensures delivery of the highxest quality in any environment I am in. After graduating from University with a degree in Sports and exercise medical sciences, my love from problem solving, and curiosity to find a futureproof career sparked my interest in programming, and that interest has only grown ever since. 

As a Makers Academy Graduate I aim to use my rapidly developing tech skills in industries that are continuosly progressing, so I am keen to work in companies that are innovative with their methods and are committed to providing tangible benefits and solutions in their sector, while giving the very best service to their clients.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

**Makers Academy** (April 2022 - August 2022)
● Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Fundamentals of object-oriented languages e.g. Ruby and Javascript.
● Test Driven Development(TDD)- Able to write meaningful tests (behaviour vs. state) based on user requirements.
● Learnt consistent debugging process to aid resolve issues.
● Designed database schemas with SQL and studied the difference between table-oriented databases vs. document-based (MongoDB).
● Used Agile values and principles (e.g. stand-ups, retros, and sprint planning) to complete coding projects.
● Pair programming in group projects to problem solve which required effective teamwork and communication. 
● Fetching and updating remote data using JS, with and without React.

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
